# termfox
couple of simple scripts to use the tinyfox.dev hourly fox api to print a fox to the terminal

put the ansiprnt python script somewhere in your path and then run the termfox bash script from anywhere

relies on having imagemagick installed to resize the images

also sometimes runs slow as hell if the fox image is huge
